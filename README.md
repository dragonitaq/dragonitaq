# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Little Intro

I'm a junior full-stack web developer from South East Asia who brings his electric guitar ðŸŽ¸ & rocks ðŸ¤˜ on stage during his time in university but not anymore into his adulthood.

It's not that sad because I found another passion which is to programmatically build something!

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on a blogging website that uses React-Static + Redux + Strapi + MongoDB.
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning React-Static & Strapi.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for combining CSS Modules with SASS while using React.
- âš¡ Little fact: I was from corporate training & consulting business before being as web dev.
